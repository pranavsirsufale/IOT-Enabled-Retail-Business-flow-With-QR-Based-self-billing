# IOT-Enabled-Retail-Business-Flow-With-QR-Based-self-billing
This project is a Smart Retail Billing System based on IoT and QR code technology.
It allows customers to scan QR codes of products, automatically fetch product details from a database, and generate a digital bill without waiting at the billing counter.

The system reduces manual work, saves time, and improves the overall shopping experience.
